def feature_extraction(spectrogram, f, t):
    """
    Extract features from the input data.
    
    Parameters:
    spectrogram: Radar spectrogram for feature extraction.
    f: Frequency bins of the spectrogram.
    t: Time bins of the spectrogram.
    
    Returns:
    dict: Extracted features.

    Features include:
    - 'normalized_std': Variance of the spectrogram, normalized by the mean.
    - 'period': Period of the signature, calculated as the mean of the time differences between peaks in the high frequency envelope (positive mirco Doppler).
    - 'offset': Offset of the signature, calculated as the difference between the mean (across time) of the high and low frequency envelopes (highest and lowest micro Doppler frequencies across time).
    - 'bandwidth': Bandwidth of the signature, calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum micro Doppler frequencies.
    - 'bandwidth_wo_uD': Bandwidth of the signature without the micro Doppler, calculated as the difference between the minimum and maximum micro Doppler frequencies.
    - 'torso frequency':  The average frequency of the peak signal in strength over the time bins within the window.
